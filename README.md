# Real_time_volatility_prediction

## Project description

The subject of the study was the real-time modeling and prediction of volatility in financial market indices, incorporating explanatory variables with different updating frequencies. Predicting volatility is crucial as it serves as a measure of financial risk. To achieve this goal, the ***GARCH-MIDAS model*** (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity - Mixed Data Sampling) was employed. The GARCH(1,1) model already captures many stylized facts of financial time series. The GARCH-MIDAS model adds a **conditional volatility decomposition into the product of two terms, potentially with distinct frequencies**.

My internship report is available in the folder ``Report&Beamer/``.
